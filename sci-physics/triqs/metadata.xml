TRIQS (Toolbox for Research on Interacting Quantum Systems) is an open-source scientific project that aims at providing a simple, efficient and flexible environment to study quantum correlations in various systems. It is designed as an extension of the python language improved by a set of modules that allow to manipulate, e.g. Greenâ€™s functions, Bravais lattices, quantum impurity solvers.
